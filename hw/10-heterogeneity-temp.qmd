title: "Heterogeneity"
params:
  number: 10
  purpose: "The purpose of this assignment is to introduce the concept of preference heterogeneity - that is, not everyone has the same preferences. We will see two ways to account for this: 1) specify preference parameters as distributions, and 2) estimate fixed parameter models on different sub-groups in your data."

# 1. Get Organized

Follow these instructions:

1. Download and edit [this template](`r url_template`).
2. Unzip the template folder. **Make sure you actually unzip it**! (in Windows, right-click it and use "extract all")
3. Open the .Rproj file to open RStudio.
4. Inside RStudio, open the ``r hw_file`` file, take notes, and write some example code as you go through the readings / exercises below.

# 2. Readings

Up until this point in the class, we have only estimated relatively simple models that assume everyone in our sample has the same preferences. That is, we only estimate a "fixed parameter" model that reflects the average preferences for the whole sample. In reality, preferences are usually _heterogeneous_ (different people have different preferences).

One way to account for this is to estimated a "mixed" logit model where we assume the preference parameters in our utility models follow some distribution across the sample (usually a normal distribution). Another way is to estimate a fixed parameter model on different sub-groups in our data. Each of these approaches are discussed in this week's video on heterogeneity. **Take notes** as you watch the video and answer the practice questions in the video as part of your reflection. You may submit your answers however you wish, e.g. hand-write them on paper and take a picture and / or type answers in your reflection .Rmd file.

# 3. Reflect

Reflect on what you've learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing? Write at least a paragraph in your ``r hw_file`` file, and include at least one question. The teaching team will review the questions we get and will try to answer them either in Slack or in class.

If you're unsure where to start with a reflection, try filling out this template:

> "I used to think ______, now I think ______ ðŸ¤”"

# 4. Submit

To submit your assignment, follow these instructions:

1. Render your .qmd file by either clicking the "Render" button in RStudio or running the command ``r paste0('quarto::quarto_render("', hw_file, '")')`` command.
2. Open the rendered html file and make sure it looks good! Is all the formatting as you expected?
3. Create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard.
