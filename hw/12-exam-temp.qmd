This week's assignment will be a take-home. The exam will be distributed in class on 11/20 and due 11/24 by 11:59pm sharp (no late submissions will be accepted). Use the template posted in the `#class` channel on slack to complete the exam. While you are free to use any other tools you wish (e.g. course content, ChatGPT, etc.), **you must work alone** on the exam.

In addition, next week we'll talk about story-telling. Watch this short video on how to start a speech (no need to submit a reflection):
