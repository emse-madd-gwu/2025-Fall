# 1. Get Organized

Follow these instructions:

1. Download and edit [this template](`r url_template`).
2. Unzip the template folder. **Make sure you actually unzip it**! (in Windows, right-click it and use "extract all")
3. Open the .Rproj file to open RStudio.
4. Inside RStudio, open the ``r hw_file`` file, take notes, and write some example code as you go through the readings / exercises below.

# 2. Readings

Next week we will start getting into designing conjoint surveys for our projects. We will implement them using [surveydown](https://surveydown.org/), which is a markdown-based platform for designing surveys. The platform allows you to use R or markdown code (just like you would in a .qmd file) to define everything you see in an online survey. While you will be editing a Quarto document, it renders into a [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) app, which you can then use to administer your survey.

To get familiar with the platform, read the following:

1. The [Introducing Surveydown](https://surveydown.org/blog/2024-08-21-introducing-surveydown/) blog post on the surveydown website.
2. The [Getting Started](https://surveydown.org/getting-started) documentation on the surveydown website.
3. The [Survey Components](https://surveydown.org/survey-components) documentation on the surveydown website.

**Take notes** as you read the blog post and go through the documentation.

# 3. Make a practice survey

For practice, try replicating one of the [demo surveys](https://surveydown.org/demos) listed on the surveydown website. Follow these steps: 

1. Download or clone the GitHub repository associated with the demo survey you chose. 
2. Open RStudio and click "Run Document", then copy-paste the localhost url into your browser to locally preview the survey. 
3. Make edits to the survey to personalize it. Choose a topic that you find interesting and try modifying at least one question in the survey, then re-render the document to see your chages. 

# 4. Reflect

Reflect on what you've learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing? Write at least a paragraph in your ``r hw_file`` file, and include at least one question. The teaching team will review the questions we get and will try to answer them either in Slack or in class.

If you're unsure where to start with a reflection, try filling out this template:

> "I used to think ______, now I think ______ ðŸ¤”"

# 5. Submit

To submit your assignment, follow these instructions:

1. Render your .qmd file by either clicking the "Render" button in RStudio or running the command ``r paste0('quarto::quarto_render("', hw_file, '")')`` command.
2. Open the rendered html file and make sure it looks good! Is all the formatting as you expected?
3. Create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment (your ``r hw_file`` and your demo survey files) and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard.
