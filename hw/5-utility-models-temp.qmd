# 1. Get Organized

Follow these instructions:

1. Download and edit [this template](`r url_template`).
2. Unzip the template folder. **Make sure you actually unzip it**! (in Windows, right-click it and use "extract all")
3. Open the .Rproj file to open RStudio.
4. Inside RStudio, open the ``r hw_file`` file, take notes, and write some example code as you go through the readings / exercises below.

# 2. Readings

Next week we will start getting into choice modeling. I have pre-recorded videos covering most of the technical concepts we will use for estimating choice models in [this Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzFdSE-D7jUQnbczxdjohRqlBBrrsaFFg). Feel free to look ahead at concepts we'll be covering over the next few weeks.

> For this coming week, you should watch the first video:<br>_Introduction to Choice Modeling_

**Take notes** as you watch the video. Throughout the video, I ask practice questions at several places - you should answer to those questions as part of your reflection. You may submit your answers however you wish, e.g. hand-write them on paper and take a picture and / or type answers in your reflection .Rmd file.

Click [here](../content/slides_choice_modeling.pdf) to download the slides in the video as a PDF.

If you are interested in more details about the logit model, see [Chapter 3 (free pdf)](https://eml.berkeley.edu/books/choice2nd/Ch03_p34-75.pdf) of Kenneth Train's book, ["Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation"](https://eml.berkeley.edu/books/choice2.html)

# 3. Reflect

Reflect on what you've learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing? Write at least a paragraph in your ``r hw_file`` file, and include at least one question. The teaching team will review the questions we get and will try to answer them either in Slack or in class.

If you're unsure where to start with a reflection, try filling out this template:

> "I used to think ______, now I think ______ ðŸ¤”"

# 4. Submit

To submit your assignment, follow these instructions:

1. Render your .qmd file by either clicking the "Render" button in RStudio or running the command ``r paste0('quarto::quarto_render("', hw_file, '")')`` command.
2. Open the rendered html file and make sure it looks good! Is all the formatting as you expected?
3. Create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard.
