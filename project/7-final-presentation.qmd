Make a slideshow presentation of your findings in your final report. You may do one of the following: 

- Create a video recording of your presentation and publish it on the web (e.g. via Youtube, Vimeo, etc.).
- Present your presentation live in class.

We will watch all the presentations together during the period scheduled for the exam (December 10, 2025).

Below is a list of specific items your presentation should include.

# 1. Format

- Your presentation should be no longer than 10 minutes in length.
- Each team member must present at least one slide.
- You may use as many slides as you feel helps you communicate your ideas (but keep the 10 minute limit in mind).
- Your title slide should include the project title, team member names, and the presentation date: December 10, 2025.
- All slides should be numbered in the bottom-left or bottom-right corners.
- Review the slide design guidelines discussed in [class](https://madd.seas.gwu.edu/2025-Fall/class/14-communicating-results.html) as a check list when designing your slides.

# 2. Recording strategies

If you choose to record your presentation, I recommend using Zoom. Have someone share their screen showing the slides and talk over the slides while recording the call.

Another option is to use a screen recording program, such as Quicktime (mac only), to record a screen recording on someone talking over the slides, though this may be challenging if not all teammates can be in the same room.

# 2. Content

Your slides do not need to include the detailed code used to conduct your analysis - that should be accessible from your report. Rather, the purpose of your presentation is to present the "big picture" overview and results from your project. You should discuss:

1. An introduction of your product / policy (similar to the introduction in your report).
2. A brief overview of your survey:
    - At least one slide depicting an example choice question
    - At least one slide with some summary stats about your sample (e.g., sample size, etc.)
3. Your main findings:
    - Polished charts of WTP, market simulations, sensitivity analyses.
    - Your recommendations based on your findings.

# 4. Publish 

If you recorded a video, publish your video recording on the web (e.g. via Youtube, Vimeo, etc.), then **send a link to the published video in a DM to Professor Helveston on slack.**

Only one team member needs to publish the video.

# 5. Submit

Create a zip file of your slides as a pdf / pptx / qmd (whatever you used to make your slides) and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard. **Only one person from your team should submit.**

# Grading Rubric

**`r maxPoints` Total Points**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
make_rubric(rubric)
