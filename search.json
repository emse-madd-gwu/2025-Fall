Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask questions in Slack, and try it again later.\nI promise, you can do this!",

Quizzes will cover material presented in previous classes and assignments during the weeks since the most-recent quiz.\nQuizzes are short (10 minutes) and are designed to test for fluency and to demonstrate where additional study is needed. Quizzes are low-stakes - your worst one is dropped, and the rest count for a small portion of your final grade. If you do poorly on one or two, use that as feedback on where you need additional improvement.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It’s a phenomenon known as the “retrieval effect” - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won’t remember them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the book “Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,” by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel.",

You need to learn how to use AI tools to learn new skills, improve productivity, and find solutions.\nWhile LLMs are pretty good, sometimes they suck. Don’t blindly trust them - they will betray you, especially with code.\nI will grade AI generated work no differently than work you produce without AI. But it’s important that you understand your work should not suck. Sometimes AI-generated work really, really sucks, so if you blindly trust an AI to do your work and submit it and it sucks, you may not like the grade.\nHere are some tips on how to work with AI tools but not generate work that sucks:\n\nDon’t submit code that doesn’t run (actually run it before submitting it).\nActually read what the AI generates.\nDon’t use methods I don’t teach. There are dozens of ways to do things - you should use the approach I teach. Using some other approach that an AI generates is a very bad idea.\n\nYour goal in using tools like ChatGPT should be to see them as an assistant - a tool to help you accomplish the task - rather than as a solutions manual. Take the time to work through the code / text these tools generate and ensure that what they provide is accurate, and if not make the corrections to fix their mistakes.\n\nCurious how LLMs actually work? Check out this article, which provides a simplified description of how they work (which itself is still quite complicated).",

Even if you work together on an assignment, write your own code.\nProviding code you have written for an assignment to anyone else in the class.\nPutting code solutions from the course assignments online.\nReceiving code-level assistance from any person not associated with the course.\nGetting someone else to write the assignment code for you.\nAsking questions about the assignments on any online services outside of the course office hours / Slack.\n\nCheating on quizzes, assignments, or the final project can include:\n\nReferring to any external resources while completing the assignment (phones, notes, etc.).\nCopying part of an answer off of another student’s paper, even if it is very small.\nUsing solutions provided by students who previously took the course.\n\n\nPenalties\nViolations will be reported to the Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities. Penalties are decided by the course instructors, and can vary based on the severity of the offense. Possible penalties include:\n\nReceiving a 0 on the assignment/quiz in question.\nReceiving a full letter grade deduction in the course.\nAutomatically failing the course.\n\nDepending on the student’s prior academic history, violations may also be accompanied by a letter to the Dean of Student Affairs, again at the instructors’ discretion. This can lead to university-level penalties, such as being suspended or expelled.\n\n\nGrace Period\nCollege is a time when you do a lot of learning. Sometimes, you might make bad decisions or mistakes. The most important thing for you to do is to learn from your mistakes, to constantly grow, and become a better person.\nSometimes, students panic and copy code right before the deadline, then regret what they did afterwards. Therefore, you may rescind any homework submission for up to 24 hours after the deadline with no questions asked. Simply email the course instructors asking to delete the submission in question, and we will do so. Deleted submissions will not be considered during plagiarism detection, though of course they will also not be graded.

For the remainder of the code, see: https://studentconduct.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity\nIn addition to the formal code of academic integrity, the instructor expects that students will treat this course with the level of professionalism required in the workplace. Remember that real firms are sponsoring student projects throughout the semester; in a workplace setting, these firms would be paying clients for the analyses being conducted. This course prepares students to succeed in the workplace, and maintaining a high degree of professionalism is expected.",

You may do one of the following:\n\nCreate a video recording of your presentation and publish it on the web (e.g. via Youtube, Vimeo, etc.).\nPresent your presentation live in class.\n\nWe will watch all the presentations together during the period scheduled for the exam (December 10, 2025).\nBelow is a list of specific items your presentation should include.\n\n1. Format\n\nYour presentation should be no longer than 10 minutes in length.\nEach team member must present at least one slide.\nYou may use as many slides as you feel helps you communicate your ideas (but keep the 10 minute limit in mind).\nYour title slide should include the project title, team member names, and the presentation date: December 10, 2025.\nAll slides should be numbered in the bottom-left or bottom-right corners.\nReview the slide design guidelines discussed in class as a check list when designing your slides.\n\n\n\n2. Recording strategies\nIf you choose to record your presentation, I recommend using Zoom. Have someone share their screen showing the slides and talk over the slides while recording the call.\nAnother option is to use a screen recording program, such as Quicktime (mac only), to record a screen recording on someone talking over the slides, though this may be challenging if not all teammates can be in the same room.\n\n\n2. Content\nYour slides do not need to include the detailed code used to conduct your analysis - that should be accessible from your report. Rather, the purpose of your presentation is to present the “big picture” overview and results from your project. You should discuss:\n\nAn introduction of your product / policy (similar to the introduction in your report).\nA brief overview of your survey:\n\nAt least one slide depicting an example choice question\nAt least one slide with some summary stats about your sample (e.g., sample size, etc.)\n\nYour main findings:\n\nPolished charts of WTP, market simulations, sensitivity analyses.\nYour recommendations based on your findings.\n\n\n\n\n4. Publish\nIf you recorded a video, publish your video recording on the web (e.g. via Youtube, Vimeo, etc.), then send a link to the published video in a DM to Professor Helveston on slack.\nOnly one team member needs to publish the video.\n\n\n5. Submit\nCreate a zip file of your slides as a pdf / pptx / qmd (whatever you used to make your slides) and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard. Only one person from your team should submit.\n\n\nGrading Rubric\n35 Total Points\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nExcellent\nGood\nNeeds work\n\n\n\n\nSlide Design\n10 / 9\nSlides are well-designed and well-organized to effectively communicate a coherent story on the project findings; design guidelines are followed.\n8 / 7 / 6\nSlides are largely well-designed and well-organized, but some include distracting or confusing elements; story is not fully coherent; design guidelinees are mostly followed.\n5 / 4 / 3\nSlides are poorly-designed and organized; frequent use of bullets and lots of text; story is poorly developed and / or does not clearly communicate findings; design guidelines are largely ignored.\n\n\nContent\n15 / 14\nAll required content is included, including a clear and concise introduction, an overview of the survey, and clear results with well-designed figures that communicate findings and recommendations.\n13 / 12\nMost required content is included, including an introduction, an overview of the survey, and results with well-designed figures that communicate findings and recommendations. Some charts may be sub-par and unclear, and some recommendations may not be clearly connected to the research results.\n11 / 10 / 9\nMultiple required content elements are missing, including an introduction, an overview of the survey, and results with figures that communicate findings and recommendations.

    "text": "3. Proposal Contents\nYour proposal should contain the following items listed as separate sections.\n\nNOTE: If your team is working on a policy project rather than a product, see the Policy Proposal Contents section below.\n\n\nAbstract\nA few sentences summarizing the overall proposal and convincing the reader why it is important. Specifically, tell the reader:\n\nWhat is the product you are studying?\nWhat key product attributes make it different than its competitors?\nWhat major research questions will you focus on for your analysis?\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nProvide a brief description and background of the product or technology. Include a picture or diagram of the product.\n\n\nMarket Opportunity\n\nIdentify Your Customer\nIf there are multiple potential markets, choose one to focus on for your analysis. Describe who you plan on taking your survey and how you intend to gain access to that population. You may survey customers of a “downstream” product, if appropriate (e.g. survey electric vehicle buyers to learn about preferences for electric vehicle battery attributes).\n\n\nIdentify Competitors\nWhich other products will compete with yours? Benchmark how competitors compare on your product’s attributes.\n\n\nIdentify Market Size\nEstimate the size of the annual market (expected sales in units per year) for this product and its competitors. Specify if your estimated annual market size is regional, national, or global, and provide references. Also address how the market size is expected to grow in the future.\n\n\n\nProduct Attributes\nA key component of your proposal is to identify the relationships between your product attributes and research questions.\nThese are the product features that consumers observe and care about. For example, price is almost always an important product attribute that influences consumer choices. You should list and describe the major product attributes you will include in your analysis. Where possible, label the product attributes on the diagram of your design. Where possible, quantify the metrics for each attribute (e.g. if one of your attributes is weight, the metric could be “kilograms”). Also list the set or range of possible levels you plan to explore for each attribute (e.g. for color you may choose the set {red, green, blue}, or for price you may choose the range $1 - $10).\nSummarize your product attributes in a table, identifying the basic features of your attributes as well as the features of current competitors. Use this example as a template.\n\n\nResearch Questions\nYour research questions are the central decisions that you are trying to inform with your project, and they often are directly related to the product attributes! For example, a research question on a project about solar panels might be “how thick should the cells be?”. This question affects multiple product attributes, such as the weight (thicker cells are heavier), price (thicker cells use more material), lifetime (cell thickness may affect how quickly a cell degrades), etc. You should discuss ~2-3 key research questions that are related to your product’s design. Discuss why you chose these questions, and note any relationship between the questions you are asking and the attributes of your product.\n\n\nOther Questions\nList major outstanding questions (e.g. about the product / technology performance metrics, market opportunities, etc.) that you will need to know to conduct your analysis and how you propose to find answers. The purpose of this section is to identify high-priority items that you will need to know early on in your project.\n\n\nAttribution\nInclude a short description of the specific contributions of each team member in your team. Here is an example:\n\n\nStudent A wrote the initial proposal draft.\nStudent B identified the market opportunity and created the product attribute table.\nStudent C helped organize project files and edited the final draft of the proposal.\n\n\nIf all members contributed equally, you can just put the single sentence “All members contributed equally”.\nTeam members who do not make meaningful contributions to their projects will not receive the same grade as that of their team mates. If you are having any issues or disputes among team members, please contact Professor Helveston ASAP so we can find a resolution.",

Specifically, tell the reader:\n\nWhat is the problem you are trying to address?\nWhat policy options are you considering to address the problem?\nWhat is the target population of your policies? Who will be affected by them?\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nProvide a brief description and background of the problem you are trying to address and the goal of the policies you are considering.\n\n\nTarget Population\nDescribe the target population for your analysis. Who will be affected by the policies you are considering? Who are you targeting these policies towards? Who are you planning on getting to take your survey, and how you intend to gain access to that population? Include an estimate of the size of the total target population.\n\n\nPolicy Options\n\nIdentify Policy Options\nWhich policies are you considering, and what are some of the potential pros and cons of them? Are some easier / more feasible to implement or enforce than others? Are some more costly to implement than others? Include a summary table comparing some basic features of each policy, e.g.\n\n\n\nPolicy\nDescription\nPro\nCon\n\n\n\n\nPolicy 1\nBrief description\nEasily implemented\nExpensive\n\n\nPolicy 2\nBrief description\nHard to enforce\nCheap\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify Policy Attributes\nFor each policy, identify the key attributes that your target population will observe. For example, if the policy involves a fee or tax, then the amount of that fee or tax would be a key attribute. For each attribute, specify the range of possible levels you plan to explore (e.g. for amount you may choose the range $1 - $10). You should choose levels that reflect the range of existing policies or potential policies. You may choose to include policies / attributes that have not yet been implemented as well.\n\n\n\nResearch Questions\nYour research questions are the central decisions that you are trying to inform with your project, and they often are directly related to the policy options and attributes.\n\n\nQuestions\nList major outstanding questions that you will need to know to conduct your analysis and how you propose to find answers. The purpose of this section is to identify high-priority items that you will need to know early on in your project.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Department: Engineering Management and Systems Engineering @ GWU\nCredits: 3\nDescription:\nThis course provides students with data analysis techniques to inform design decisions in an uncertain, competitive market; topics include consumer choice modeling, programming in the R programming language, survey design, conjoint analysis, optimization, market simulation, and professional communication skills. Over the course of the semester, students will learn and apply theory and methods to a team project to assess the market competitiveness of an emerging product / technology and use marketing analytics to generate design insights. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using Quarto (which is built on the ideas of RMarkdown). At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a presentation of their findings. This course has a “flipped” classroom structure. Students will spend the majority of class time working through guiding practice exercises or working on their projects. To prepare for class, students must complete weekly assignments that involve watching and reviewing recorded lecture materials and answering related practice questions.\nLearning Objectives:\nHaving successfully completed this course, students will be able to:\n\nImport, wrangle, visualize, and export data in R.\nDesign surveys to obtain informative data about consumer preferences for product features.\nBuild and estimate discrete choice models.\nAnalyze consumer choice data to estimate consumer preferences for product features.\nDesign and create effective charts and presentations.\nCommunicate results in terms of design insights.\n\nPrerequisites:\nThis course requires prior exposure to:\n\nProbability theory\nMultivariable calculus\nLinear algebra\nRegression\n\nEach of these concepts will be applied throughout the course, and no time will be spent reviewing the foundational elements of each concept.\nIn addition, we will work in the R programming language throughout the course, but no prior programming experience is required. We will spend the first three weeks going through exercises to get up to speed in R.\nStudents are encouraged to complete this self assessment prior to registering for the course to self-assess familiarity with these concepts.",

Readings\nThis is your last homework! Okay, well not really - your homework next week will be a take home exam. But don’t worry, we will spend our time in class next week going over the entire class, so there will be time to get answers to any questions you have.\nFor this week, the only thing you will look over is the concept of a sensitivity analysis. Last week in class we covered how to use our estimated logit model to conduct a market simulation, which gave us predicted market shares for different products. Naturally, one of the key things we might want to know is how sensitive our predicted market shares are to changes in our attributes.\nTo understand how we calculate such sensitivities, take a look at the logitr-cars repo. Download the repo using this link, then open the R project file to open RStudio. Then in RStudio, open the following two files:\n\n9.1-compute-sensitivity.R\n9.2-plot-sensitivity.R\n\nYour job this week is to go through each of these files line-by-line to make sure you understand what is being done. (It might also help to look back at some of the earlier files we covered as a refresher, such as 3.1 on estimating models or 5.1 on uncertainty).\nLet’s start with the first file, 9.1. In this file, we use the predict() function to compute market shares for different markets.\nIn the first sensitivity analysis, we define a baseline market, then we create repeated copies of this market but with incremental changes to the price of alternative 2. When we use predict(), we get predicted probabilities for each market, which we can then use to see how the predicted probability for alternative 2 changes with price.\nIn the second sensitivity analysis, we also start with repeated copies of our baseline market, but then we substitute in a series of different cases where we change the values of other attributes. Each case has a “low” and “high” value, where “high” means they result in expected higher market shares, and “low” means the opposite. Again, we use predict() to obtain predicted market shares for each scenario.\nAt the bottom of the script, we save the data frames.\nIn 9.2, we use the saved results to visualize the results computed in 9.1. This code shows us how to create line plots of the predicted market share versus price as well as revenue versus price. The third chart is a “tornado” plot, which shows us the predicted market share for each of the “high” and “low” conditions in 9.1.\nThese charts – sensitivity to price, and sensitivity to changes in other attributes – will be important charts to include in your final analysis report. You can use these examples to help you create similar charts for your project.\nOnce you have gone through each file, consider what might make a good “baseline” market for your project, then write your reflection.\n\n\n3. Reflect\nReflect on what you’ve learned while going through these exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing? Write at least a paragraph in your hw11.qmd file, and include at least one question. The teaching team will review the questions we get and will try to answer them either in Slack or in class.\nIf you’re unsure where to start with a reflection, try filling out this template:\n\n“I used to think ______, now I think ______ 🤔”\n\n\n\n4. Submit\nTo submit your assignment, follow these instructions:\n\nRender your .qmd file by either clicking the “Render” button in RStudio or running the command quarto::quarto_render(\"hw11.qmd\") command.\nOpen the rendered html file and make sure it looks good!

Readings\nUp until this point in the class, we have only estimated relatively simple models that assume everyone in our sample has the same preferences. That is, we only estimate a “fixed parameter” model that reflects the average preferences for the whole sample. In reality, preferences are usually heterogeneous (different people have different preferences).\nOne way to account for this is to estimated a “mixed” logit model where we assume the preference parameters in our utility models follow some distribution across the sample (usually a normal distribution). Another way is to estimate a fixed parameter model on different sub-groups in our data. Each of these approaches are discussed in this week’s video on heterogeneity. Take notes as you watch the video and answer the practice questions in the video as part of your reflection. You may submit your answers however you wish, e.g. hand-write them on paper and take a picture and / or type answers in your reflection .Rmd file.\nClick here to download the slides in the video as a PDF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.

Over the course of the semester, students will learn and apply theory and methods to a team project to assess the market competitiveness of an emerging product / technology and use marketing analytics to generate design insights. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using Quarto (which is built on the ideas of RMarkdown). At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a presentation of their findings. This course has a “flipped” classroom structure. Students will spend the majority of class time working through guiding practice exercises or working on their projects. To prepare for class, students must complete weekly assignments that involve watching and reviewing recorded lecture materials and answering related practice questions.\nThis course was first created by Dr. John Paul Helveston at the George Washington University for the Spring 2019 semester of EMSE 6035, which was previously called Marketing of Technology.

    "text": "Installing packages from Github: the BRRR library\nThe vast majority of the time, you will install external packages using the install.packages() function. This installs packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), where most packages are published. But you can also install packages that are under development or haven’t been published to CRAN yet. Most of the time, these packages are hosted on GitHub - an online platform for sharing code (it’s also where all of the files that make up this website are stored).\nTo install a package from GitHub, you first need to install the remotes library. Then you can use the remotes::install_github()` function to install packages directly from GitHub. To try this out, install the remotes library, then trying installing the BRRR package:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"brooke-watson/BRRR\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPackages on GitHub are in development and often require other packges to work. So if you get an installation error about some other package dependency, try restarting your R session and try again.\n\n\nNot sure what this package does? Well, one of the other nice things about packages listed on GitHub is the authors tend to write detailed descriptions - check out the GitHub page for the BRRR package. Then try using the BRRR::skrrrahh() function with different number arguments (turn your volume up). In the #welcome channel on slack, post your favorite argument to skrrrahh() (mine is 24)."

    "text": "Throughout the semester, you will work in teams of 3-4 students towards a final project. The project will have three phases:\n\nProject proposal\nPilot survey & analysis\nFinal survey & analysis\n\nTeams will apply topics covered in class to develop quantitative models of consumer choice to inform design decisions for a novel product, technology, or policy. Each team will have somewhat different tasks and areas of emphasis, depending on the product selected; however, all projects will be expected to demonstrate mastery of the topics covered in class and to address the criteria and guidelines required for project assignments.\nSummary of Deliverables: To make the overall project more manageable, it is broken down into separate “milestone” deliverables due throughout the semester, starting with a proposal.\n\n\n\n\nItem\nWeight towardsfinal grade\nDue Date(by 11:59pm)\n\n\n\n\nProject Proposal\n5 %\nSep. 21\n\n\nSurvey Plan\n5 %\nSep. 30\n\n\nPilot Survey\n5 %\nOct. 14\n\n\nPilot Analysis\n5 %\nNov. 02\n\n\nFinal Survey\n5 %\nNov. 16\n\n\nFinal Analysis Report\n15 %\nDec. 07\n\n\nFinal Presentation\n5 %\nDec. 09\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Selection\nI want this project to be as useful for you and your future career as possible - you’ll hopefully want to show off your final project in a portfolio or during job interviews. Accordingly, you get to choose the topic for your project, but it must meet certain guidelines.\nProjects must be selected during the first two weeks of class. Projects much be an emerging technology, product, or policy with a clearly identified market that has not yet been introduced into the mass market, such as a new invention from a research laboratory at GWU or a new product being explored by a firm. Students have the option to choose a sponsored project or propose their own project if it is approved by the instructor and meets the following criteria:\n\nInnovative / Emerging: The proposed project involves a new product or technology with attributes (e.g. price, efficiency, reliability, size, performance, color, etc.) that may be competitive in the marketplace but for which actual market adoption is still uncertain.\nWell-Defined: This course focuses on mathematical modeling to support design decision-making. There is not sufficient time in the course for conceptual design of a new product.\nIdentified Target Market: A target market has been identified for this new product or technology. Competing products in that market are known, and the attributes on which new market entrants compete can be identified. Representative potential customers can be identified for survey solicitation. If the new product or technology is a component of a larger product sold to a consumer market, students may assess the market implications for the final consumer product.\nPrior to Mass Commercialization: The new product or technology has only recently or has not yet been introduced to the mass market.\nModerate Scope and Complexity: The product or technology should involve moderate complexity. For example, a non-differentiated commodity, such as sugar, is too simple, and a complex product involving many components and manufacturing operations, such as a vehicle, is too complex.\nExpertise: If the product involves a new technology that requires specialized knowledge about its attributes, the team should have reliable access to experts who can supply the requisite knowledge.\nDecision Variables: The product should have several non-trivial design decisions. For example, choosing between two materials or topologies, setting dimensions of a component, or selecting among a set of alternative component configurations are suitable design decisions. The models developed in the project will be used to support decision-making along such dimensions.\n\n\n\nTeamwork\nThe experience of working in teams on this project will serve as preparation for teamwork throughout your careers. Some teams may experience an imbalance in team member contributions, effort, or reliability. The instructor is available to provide advice and interact in resolving team inequity and conflict; however, students should view this as a learning experience. Such situations regularly occur in any career, and learning how to handle them is a valuable skill. If you experience challenges within your team, it is a good opportunity to develop strategies and figure out how you will address such challenges in the future. One common job interview question is, “Describe a time when you experienced difficulties working in a team or experienced a team failure. What did you do about it?” This is a good chance to build a strong answer to this question.",

This plan does not have to be “set in stone” but rather a first attempt at defining the scope and general content of your survey. The course instructor will review and grade your plan and provide written feedback to guide the development of your pilot survey. Follow the instructions below to prepare your survey plan.\n\n1. Get Organized\nDownload and unzip this template for your survey plan. Open the survey_plan.Rproj file and write your plan in the survey_plan.qmd file. The template comes with some text and code explaining how to use it - you should delete this code / text as it is only for explanatory purposes. Be sure to adjust the content in the YAML:\n\nWrite your project title in the title field (and provide a subtitle if you wish, or delete the subtitle field).\nIn the author field, list the names of all teammates, e.g. author: Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, and Han Solo.\n\n\n\n2. Specify the Target Population\nWhat is the ideal population you would like to take your survey? If you cannot access this population, is there a different or similar population that you are planning to target?\nWrite out your eligibility requirements for people to be considered part of your target population. Be specific. Write the exact question language you plan to use in your survey (e.g. “Are you a car owner?”) to identify the target sample. You may need to ask more than one question.\nBy default, we will pay users on prolific.co (i.e. people from the general U.S. population) to take your survey, but if a specific subpopulation is required (e.g. people currently shopping for a car), list that here and perhaps one or two strategies for reaching that population. If you have any other opportunities to distribute your survey to the target population (e.g. an external collaborator, personal networks, etc.), list those here.\n\n\n3. Attributes and Levels for Choice Questions\nWrite the text of the choice question you plan on asking your respondents. Below your question, list in a table the attributes and levels you will include in your choice questions (these may change between now and the actual final survey).\nFor example, for a survey on car preferences, you might use this as a choice question:\n\n“If these were your only options, which vehicle would you choose?”\n\nAnd you might use these as your attributes and levels:\n\n\n\nAttribute\nLevels\nUnit\n\n\n\n\nPrice\n15, 20, 25\n$1000\n\n\nFuel economy\n20, 25, 30\nMiles per gallon\n\n\nAcceleration time\n6, 7, 8\nSeconds (from 0-60 mph)\n\n\nPowertrain\nGasoline, Electric\nType\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Survey Content\nYour survey plan should include the following additional content (much of this will go directly into your pilot survey):\n\nWelcome page text: Welcome your survey respondents and inform them in just a few sentences who you are and what the survey is about.\nConsent page text: Write out the text of a consent form and include restrictions at least for 18 years of age and the statement “I have read and understand the above information” (in your survey, this can go on the welcome page).\nEducation information: Write out descriptions of the attributes you will include in your conjoint choice questions so that you can explain them to your survey respondents. Use common, simple language and as few words as possible. Include illustrative images if possible.\nCritical respondent information: What pieces of information about your respondent are absolutely necessary for your analysis (e.g. demographic factors like income, age, etc., or other information specific to the market for your product). Again, write the specific questions you plan on asking.\nOther questions: What other information about your respondents would be helpful in your analysis? Are you planning on asking any behavioral or demographic questions? Include the specific question text you plan to include.\n\n\n\n4. Attribution\nInclude a short description of the specific contributions of each team member for this report. If all members contributed equally, you can just put the single sentence “All members contributed equally”.\nTeam members who do not make meaningful contributions to their projects will not receive the same grade as that of their team mates. If you are having any issues or disputes among team members, please contact Professor Helveston ASAP so we can find a resolution.\n\n\n5. Submit\nRender your survey_plan.qmd file, then create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard. Only one person from your team should submit the report.\n\n\nGrading Rubric\n35 Total Points\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nExcellent\nGood\nNeeds work\n\n\n\n\nOrganization & Formatting\n5\nAll formatting guidelines are followed; YAML is correct with all team members listed; Rmd compiles to html.\n4\nMost formatting guidelines are followed; YAML is correct with all team members listed; Rmd might require one fix to compile to html.\n3\nSeveral or all formatting guidelines not followed; YAML contains elements that aren't updated from the template; Rmd requires mutliple fixes to compile to html.\n\n\nTarget Population\n10 / 9\nTarget population clearly identified; fielding strategy is discussed; eligibility requirement question text is specified.\n8 / 7 / 6\nTarget population identified, though may need to be refined; fielding strategy is discussed; eligibility requirement question text needs to be refined.\n5 / 4 / 3\nTarget population unclear; fielding strategy missing; eligibility requirement question text needs to be refined or is missing.\n\n\nAttributes & Levels\n10 / 9\nChoice question text is clear and specific; table of all attributes are included.\n8 / 7 / 6\nChoice question text could be improved; table of all attributes are included with some attributes missing.\n5 / 4 / 3\nChoice question text is missing or poorly written / unclear; table of all attributes is missing or unclear.\n\n\nSurvey Content\n10 / 9\nAll required survey components are specified with clear, precise question text included.\n8 / 7 / 6\nSome but not all required survey components are specified.\n5 / 4 / 3\nMissing multiple of the required survey components, question text is unclear.",

The course instructor will review and grade your analysis and report and provide feedback. The primary purpose of the report is to 1) lay some initial groundwork for analyzing your survey data (you will be able to re-use this code for your final analysis), and 2) gain insights to improve your final survey.\nYour report should include three main components:\n\nA detailed description of your pilot survey (e.g., how it was designed, what it contained, etc.).\nA detailed description of the results from analyzing your pilot survey data.\nA detailed description of planned changes you will include in your final survey.\n\nFollow the guidelines below to prepare your analysis and report.\n\n1.

The report should be proof-read before submission to correct any grammatical or spelling errors. Spell checking can be automated by installing the spelling package and running this in the R console:\n\nspelling::spell_check_files(\"report.qmd\")\n\nAll figures, tables, and equations should be referenced in the text.\n\n\n2. Pilot Data Analysis\nBefore writing your report, you should first analyze your pilot data by following these steps:\n\nDownload the survey response data from your Supabase account. You can import the data directly using the sd_get_data() function (see the documentation page for details). Save the raw data in the “data” folder in the report template.\nOpen the clean-data.R file and write code to clean your pilot data and prepare it for modeling. Your cleaned choice data should be in a “long” format similar to the example choice data here.\nSave your cleaned data file as a .csv file in the “data” folder.\nOpen the modeling.R file and write code to estimate preliminary models using your cleaned choice data.\nOpen the power-analysis.R file and write code to conduct a power analysis to inform the sample size requirements for your final survey.\n\n\n\n3. Pilot Analysis Report\nYour report should contain the following items listed as separate sections.\n\nNOTE: You may re-use content from earlier project assignments in this report, such as introductory paragraphs, images, etc.\n\n\nAbstract\nA few sentences summarizing the project and what you found from your pilot analysis. Include:\n\nWhat is the product / policy you are studying?\nWhat were the product attributes and design decisions you were interested in?\nAt least one key insight you gained from your pilot analysis (e.g., a modeling result, a design change you will make for your final survey, etc.).\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nProvide a brief description and background of the product / policy that motivates the study of it. Include a picture or diagram of the product. You should also discuss the key product attributes and decisions variables you chose to study in your pilot survey. This section can be largely similar to your proposal introduction.\n\n\nSurvey Design\nThis section should discuss the design choices you made in creating your pilot survey. Include the following:\n\nDescribe the eligibility requirements you chose and why you chose them.\nWhat information about your respondents did you collect (e.g. critical information questions, demographics, etc.)?\nDescribe any educational material presented to the respondents.\nDefine and justify the attributes and levels chosen for your conjoint choice questions. Indicate the number of alternatives per choice question and the number of choice questions per respondent.\nIf you included a “no-choice” option, define its meaning and state how that was communicated to the respondent.\nInclude an example figure of a random conjoint question (this can be a screen shot).\n\nYou should include a full copy of your survey in an appendix (see the Appendix section below)\n\n\nPilot Data Analysis\nThis section should describe the analysis you carried out using your pilot data, including the following subsections:\n\nSample Description\nDescribe your respondent sample, including the total sample size, the total number of choice question responses, and summary statistics of how your sample varies across critical information questions, demographics, etc. You should also include a description of what your target demographics should look like and compare these to your pilot sample (obviously your pilot sample was your classmates, so it may not be too representative of the target).\n\n\nData Cleaning\nDescribe any filtering process you applied to your data. Summarize how many acceptable vs. rejected responses you kept in your analysis and justify how you made that determination.\n\n\nModeling\nWrite out the specific utility model you estimated. This online LaTeX equation editor might come in handy for this (also, some example LaTeX equations can be found in the class notes from previous classes). Include a summary table of your utility coefficient estimates with standard errors. You should also include summary figures of the estimated coefficients for all attributes. Your figures should include uncertainty bounds. Interpret and discuss the implications of your findings.\n\n\nPower Analysis\nYou should also include a description of conclusions from your power analysis, including a summary figure of your power analysis results (standard errors versus sample size).\n\n\n\nChanges to Final Survey\nBased on your analyses, write a description of any changes you plan on making to your final survey (which should be based on your pilot survey). Consider the following:\n\nDid you make any changes to the product attributes and / or levels?\nDo you expect to be able to obtain the necessary sample size for your analysis?\nOther useful feedback did you receive from respondents / classmates that informed a design change.\n\n\n\nAttribution\nInclude a short description of the specific contributions of each team member for this report. If all members contributed equally, you can just put the single sentence “All members contributed equally”.\nTeam members who do not make meaningful contributions to their projects will not receive the same grade as that of their team mates. If you are having any issues or disputes among team members, please contact Professor Helveston ASAP so we can find a resolution.\n\n\nAppendix\nYou should include a full copy of your conjoint survey in an appendix at the end of this report (i.e., the same information and questions respondents saw when taking the survey). This can be the same content used in your .qmd files from the last project assignment (the pilot survey). For the conjoint choice questions, you only need to include one example since the specific levels were different for each choice question.\n\n\n\n4. Submit\nRender your .qmd files, then create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard.

Your final report should be a fully reproducible html webpage. It should include text, data, code, and plots. Your report should be written in a narrative format (i.e. using coherent paragraphs rather than a series of bullet points). You may use headings where appropriate to break up your report into sections. There is no length requirement - your report should be sufficiently detailed to address the requirements listed below and sufficiently concise such that it is expressed in the fewest necessary words.\nYour report should include three main components:\n\nA detailed description of your survey (e.g., how it was designed, what it contained, etc.).\nA detailed description of your analysis of your survey data and the results you found.\nA detailed description of the key insights you obtained from your experiment and your design recommendations based on those insights.\n\nFollow the guidelines below to prepare your analysis and report.\n\n1. Report Guidelines\nDownload and unzip this template for your report. You should write your report in the report.qmd file. The template comes with some text and code explaining how to use it - you should delete this code & text as it is only for explanatory purposes. Be sure to adjust the content in the YAML:\n\nWrite your project title in the title field (and provide a subtitle if you wish, or delete the subtitle field).\nIn the author field, list the names of all teammates, e.g. author: Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, and Han Solo.\n\nYour report should be written in a clear, concise, and logically-structured manner so that a reader can easily understand the ideas presented. The report should be proof-read before submission to correct any grammatical or spelling errors. Spell checking can be automated by installing the spelling package and running this in the R console:\n\nspelling::spell_check_files(\"report.qmd\")\n\nAll figures, tables, and equations should be referenced in the text.\n\n\n2. Data Analysis\nBefore writing your report, you should first analyze your data by following these steps:\n\nDownload the survey response data from your Supabase account. You can import the data directly using the sd_get_data() function (see the documentation page for details). Save the raw data in the “data” folder in the report template.\nOpen the clean-data.R file and write code to clean your pilot data and prepare it for modeling. Your cleaned choice data should be in a “long” format similar to the example choice data here.\nSave your cleaned data file as a .csv file in the “data” folder.\nOpen the modeling.R file and write code to estimate any models you will use in your analysis. At a minimum, you should estimate:\n\nA simple logit model that includes all of the attributes in your survey.\nA mixed logit model that allows at least some of those attributes to vary randomly according to assumed distributions.\nAt least one sub-group analysis where you compare a logit model on different sub-groups in your sample.\n\nOpen the analysis.R file and write code to conduct further analyses using the results from your estimated models. At a minimum, you should include:\n\nEstimates of consumer WTP for each attribute in your survey, along with corresponding plots of WTP. Your estimates and plots should include both the mean estimates and a 95% confidence interval. (Policy projects may omit estimates of WTP if they are not applicable and instead should report utility coefficients).\nAt least one market simulation comparing your product against competitors along with an accompanying plot. (Policy projects should compare different policies).\nA sensitivity analysis showing your product’s market share sensitivity to changes in price as well as changes in other attributes in your survey along with accompanying plots.\n\n\n\n\n3. Final Analysis Report\nYour report should contain the following items listed as separate sections.\n\nNOTE: You may re-use content from earlier project assignments in this report, such as introductory paragraphs, images, etc.\n\n\nAbstract\nA few sentences summarizing your experiment and your main findings along with design recommendations. Include:\n\nWhat is the product / policy you are studying?\nWhat were the product attributes and design decisions you were interested in?\nWhat are the key insights and recommendations you are making based on those insights?\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nProvide a brief description and background of the product / policy that motivates the study of it. Include a picture or diagram of the product. You should also discuss the key product attributes and decisions variables you chose to study in your survey. This section can be largely similar to your proposal introduction.\n\n\nSurvey Design\nThis section should discuss the design choices you made in creating your survey. Include the following:\n\nDescribe the eligibility requirements you chose and why you chose them. These should be the question(s) you used to filter respondents in or out of your survey.\nWhat information about your respondents did you collect (e.g. critical information questions, demographics, etc.)?\nDescribe any educational material presented to the respondents.\nDefine and justify the attributes and levels chosen for your conjoint choice questions. Indicate the number of alternatives per choice question and the number of choice questions per respondent.\nInclude table summarizing the attributes and levels you included in your survey.\nDescribe any major changes you made between your pilot survey and final survey.\nInclude an example figure of a random conjoint question (this can be a screen shot or you can use Rmarkdown code to generate an example).\n\nYou should include a full copy of your survey in an appendix (see the Appendix section below)\n\n\nData Analysis\nThis section should describe the analysis you carried out using your final survey data, including the following subsections:\n\nSample Description\nDescribe your respondent sample, including the total sample size, the total number of choice question responses, and summary statistics of how your sample varies across critical information questions, demographics, etc. Include a summary table showing the breakdown of different demographic questions you asked on your survey. Tables should be formatted (e.g., using kable()), not just print outs from code chunks.\n\n\nData Cleaning\nDescribe any filtering process you applied to your data. Summarize how many acceptable vs. rejected responses you kept in your analysis and justify how you made that determination.\n\n\nModeling\nWrite out the specific utility model you estimated for your baseline logit model (you don’t need to include descriptions of the other models as they are derivative from the baseline model). This online LaTeX equation editor might come in handy for this (also, some example LaTeX equations are provided in the practice-solutions.qmd files from previous classes). Include a summary table of your utility coefficient estimates with standard errors.\n\n\n\nResults\nShow your plots\nInsert and discuss your plot(s) of WTP for product attributes with simulated 95% confidence intervals, using a common scale for the y-axis across plots (policy projects, show plots of utility coefficients). Interpret the results and identify key attributes that drive consumer choice.\nClearly define and justify your simulated market scenario(s) using a table listing the attributes of your product(s) and competitor products. Report simulated market shares with simulated 95% confidence intervals. Discuss key insights from these simulations. Discuss opportunities for increasing demand – what attributes drive market adoption, and what ranges of values for your product attributes result in more competitive outcomes?\nDiscuss the sensitivity of market demand predictions to product attributes and include at least one “tornado” plot as well as plots of market share vs. price. Identify the best price point and design decisions in terms of maximizing revenue for your product and state the uncertainty of these estimates.\nExplain the limitations of your analysis (e.g. survey sample representativeness, issues outside the scope of your model that could influence your assessment and recommendations, etc.).\n\n\nFinal Recommendations and Conclusions\nDescribe your key insights and resulting recommendations:\n\nDoes the product have the potential to be competitive against current competitors? At what price ranges? How confident are you? What key unknowns or uncertainties could most influence profitability? (For policy projects, discuss comparisons of policy interventions).\nWhat are your recommendations for key decisions on price and other decision variables, and how robust are these recommendations?\nWhat are the top opportunities you identified for increasing demand / market success of your product?\n\n\n\nLimitations\nDescribe limitations:\n\nIdentify what information would be most valuable to collect next in order to address limitations of the analysis and support decision-making.\nDescribe the most important unknowns that could affect your findings.\n\n\n\nAttribution\nInclude a short description in your blackboard submission of the specific contributions of each team member for this report. If all members contributed equally, you can just put the single sentence “All members contributed equally”.\nTeam members who do not make meaningful contributions to their projects will not receive the same grade as that of their team mates. If you are having any issues or disputes among team members, please contact Professor Helveston ASAP so we can find a resolution.\n\n\nAppendix\nYour appendix should include:\n\nA full copy of your conjoint survey (for the conjoint choice questions, include just one example since the specific levels were different for each choice question).\nAny other supplementary information that could not be included into the main report.\n\n\n\n\n5. Submit\nRender your report.qmd file, then create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard. Only one person from your team should submit the report.\n\n\nGrading Rubric\n40 Total Points\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nExcellent\nGood\nNeeds work\n\n\n\n\nOrganization & Formatting\n5\nAll formatting guidelines are followed.\n4\nMost formatting guidelines are followed; only one or two components from the template are missing.\n3\nMost formatting guidelines are followed; several components from the template are missing or incomplete.\n\n\nData Analysis\n15 / 14\nAll analysis requirements are followed, including data cleaning, modeling, and analysis, and all modeling and analysis is correctly specified.

    "text": "You should install and set everything here before the first day of class.\n\n\nSign up for Slack. You should have been sent a link to join in the course intro email. If not, email Professor Helveston for an invite link. I recommend using your @gwu.edu email to sign up, but if you use another email for another Slack then use that.\nInstall the Slack app on your phone and Turn notifications on!. I’ll send all course communication via Slack, so please make sure your notifications are on so you don’t miss anything.\nInstall the latest version of R and RStudio:\n\n\nDownload and install R (version 4.0.2 or higher)\nDownload and install RStudio (Desktop version)\n\n\nOptional: Posit has a new IDE called Positron, which is similar to RStudio but has some new features. I encourage you to try it out if you want, but it’s not required for this course. You can download it here.\n\n\nIf you have a Mac, install XQuartz. This is needed for making some figures and is only for Mac (if you’re on Windows or Linux, skip this step).\nDownload and install Quarto\nSign up for Posit Cloud1 (the free version). It’s basically the same thing as RStudio, but accessible via a web browser. If things aren’t working on your computer, this is a great backup to quickly get back to working in RStudio.\nYou’ll need to install some R packages in RStudio that we will use throughout the semester. To do so, open RStudio then copy-paste this code into the console and press Return. This will install all the packages listed in the file.\n\nThat’s it - you’re all set for class!",
