# Full factorial design

Full factorial design of experiment for 3 effects: A, B, C

A: Electric? (Yes+ or No-)
B: Warranty? (Yes+ or No-)
C: Ford? (Yes+ or No-)

```{r}
profiles <- cbc_profiles(
    electric = c(1, 0),
    warranty = c(1, 0),
    ford     = c(1, 0)
)

profiles
```

## Balanced?

All levels appear an equal number of times.

```{r}
profiles %>% count(electric)
profiles %>% count(warranty)
profiles %>% count(ford)
```

## Orthogonal? 

All pairs of levels appear together an equal number of times.

```{r}
pairs <- profiles %>% 
    mutate(
        electric_warranty = electric == warranty,
        warranty_ford = warranty == ford,
        electric_ford = electric == ford
    )

pairs %>% count(electric_warranty)
pairs %>% count(warranty_ford)
pairs %>% count(electric_ford)
```



# Fractional factorial design w/confounded main effects

```{r}
profiles_frac1 <- profiles[c(1,4,5,8), ]
profiles_frac1
```

Balanced?

```{r}
profiles_frac1 %>% count(electric)
profiles_frac1 %>% count(warranty)
profiles_frac1 %>% count(ford)
```

Orthogonal? 

```{r}
pairs <- profiles_frac1 %>% 
    mutate(
        electric_warranty = electric == warranty,
        warranty_ford = warranty == ford,
        electric_ford = electric == ford
    )

pairs %>% count(electric_warranty)
pairs %>% count(warranty_ford)
pairs %>% count(electric_ford)
```

"electric" and "warranty" are confounded!



# Fractional factorial design w/confounded interaction effects

```{r}
profiles_frac2 <- profiles[c(1,4,6,7), ]
profiles_frac2
```

Balanced?

```{r}
profiles_frac2 %>% count(electric)
profiles_frac2 %>% count(warranty)
profiles_frac2 %>% count(ford)
```

Orthogonal? 

```{r}
pairs <- profiles_frac2 %>% 
    mutate(
        electric_warranty = electric == warranty,
        warranty_ford = warranty == ford,
        electric_ford = electric == ford
    )

pairs %>% count(electric_warranty)
pairs %>% count(warranty_ford)
pairs %>% count(electric_ford)
```

No main effects are confounded!

Examine confounding between main and interaction effects:

```{r}
pairs <- pairs %>% 
    mutate(
        electric__electric_warranty = electric == electric_warranty,
        electric__warranty_ford = electric == warranty_ford,
        electric__electric_ford = electric == electric_ford,
        warranty__electric_warranty = warranty == electric_warranty,
        warranty__warranty_ford = warranty == warranty_ford,
        warranty__electric_ford = warranty == electric_ford,
        ford__electric_warranty = ford == electric_warranty,
        ford__warranty_ford = ford == warranty_ford,
        ford__electric_ford = ford == electric_ford
    )

# "electric" main effect with interactions:
pairs %>% count(electric__electric_warranty)
pairs %>% count(electric__warranty_ford)
pairs %>% count(electric__electric_ford)

# "warranty" main effect with interactions:
pairs %>% count(warranty__electric_warranty)
pairs %>% count(warranty__warranty_ford)
pairs %>% count(warranty__electric_ford)

# "ford" main effect with interactions:
pairs %>% count(ford__electric_warranty)
pairs %>% count(ford__warranty_ford)
pairs %>% count(ford__electric_ford)
```

- "electric" is confounded with "warranty_ford" interaction
- "warranty" is confounded with "electric_ford" interaction
- "ford" is confounded with "electric_warranty" interaction
