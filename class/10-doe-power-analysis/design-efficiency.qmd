# Measuring D-efficiency of experiment designs

Make a simple design of experiment for a conjoint survey on apples

First, define the attributes and levels:

```{r}
profiles <- cbc_profiles(
  price       = c(15, 20, 25), # Price ($1,000)
  fuelEconomy = c(20, 25, 30), # Fuel economy (mpg)
  accelTime   = c(6, 7, 8),    # 0-60 mph acceleration time (s)
  powertrain  = c('Gasoline', 'Electric')
)
```

Make a randomized full-factorial design:

```{r}
design_rand <- cbc_design(
  profiles = profiles,
  n_resp   = 500, # Number of respondents
  n_alts   = 3,   # Number of alternatives per question
  n_q      = 6    # Number of questions per respondent
)

head(design)

cbc_balance(design_rand)
cbc_overlap(design_rand)
```

Make a Bayesian D-efficient fractional factorial design:

```{r}
design_db_eff <- cbc_design(
  profiles  = profiles,
  n_resp    = 500, # Number of respondents
  n_alts    = 3, # Number of alternatives per question
  n_q       = 6, # Number of questions per respondent
  n_start   = 5, 
  n_blocks  = 1,
  priors = list(
    price       = -0.1,
    fuelEconomy = 0.1,
    accelTime   = -0.1,
    powertrain  = -4
  ), 
  method = "CEA"
)

head(design_db_eff)

cbc_balance(design_db_eff)
cbc_overlap(design_db_eff)
```

Tuning Parameters:

- `n_start`: Number of random starts when searching for D-efficient design.
- `n_blocks`: Number of blocks used for D-efficient design. More blocks increases overall efficiency (more people see more different questions), but increases computation time to create design.
- Change `method` to `"Modfed"`: Use the modified Federov algorithm instead of `"CEA"`.
