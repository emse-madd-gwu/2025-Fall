# Practice Question 1

Consider the following experiment design

<div style="width:200px">
a | b | c | Effect
--|---|---|-------
+ | - | - | A
- | + | - | B 
+ | - | + | AC 
- | + | + | BC 
</div>

</center>

a) Is the design balanced? Is is orthogonal?

- Balanced:  YES/NO? 
- Othogonal: YES/NO? 

Check: 

```{r}
# Write code here
```

The design is NOT orthogonal because A is always equal to -B.

b) Write out the equation to compute the main effect for a, b, and c. 

c) Are any main effects confounded? If so, what are they confounded with?
