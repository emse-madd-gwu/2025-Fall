# Learning Objectives

### After this class, you will know how to... 

- ### ...work with data in `r fa('r-project')`
- ### ...design effective surveys to get rich data
- ### ...analyze consumer choice data to model consumer preferences
- ### ...design effective charts to communicate insights

# Course prerequisites

### This course requires prior exposure to:

- ### Probability theory
- ### Multivariable calculus
- ### Linear algebra
- ### Regression

### **Not sure?** 

### Take [this self assessment](https://madd.seas.gwu.edu/2024-Fall/self-assessment.html)

# Reflections (30% of grade)

### Do some readings, recorded lectures, practice problems

### Write a short reflection

--

## `r fa('calendar')` ~Every week (10 total)

--

## `r fa('clock')` Due 11:59pm Tues. before class

--

## `r fa('check')` Graded for completion (looking for engagement)

---

# **Quizzes** (10% of grade)

--

## `r fa('calendar')` At the start of class every other week-is. Make ups only for excused absences (i.e. don't be late).

--

## `r fa('calendar')` 5 total, lowest dropped

--

## `r fa('clock')` ~5 - 10 minutes

--

> **Why quiz at all?** The "retrieval effect" - basically, you have to _practice_ remembering things, otherwise your brain won't remember them (see the book ["Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning"](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674729018))

# Exam (10% of grade)

### Take home exam, 2nd to last week of class

### We'll go over exam solutions on last day of class

## Use of chatGPT and other AI tools

- Large language models (LLMs) are pretty good...but sometimes suck.

--
 
- Use of AI tools is generally permitted, but **be transparent**.

- All assignments must include a **Use of AI on this assignment** section where you:

    - Describe any AI tool and how it was used along with prompt(s) used.
    - Include a link to the chat transcript.

## **Use AI as an assistant, not a solutions manual**

> Curious how LLMs actually work? Check out [this article](https://www.understandingai.org/p/large-language-models-explained-with), which provides a simplified description of how they work (which itself is still quite complicated).

# Engineers often design things nobody wants!

## We want to answers to questions like...

<br>

--

### - Higher prices decrease demand, but by how much?

--

### - How much more is a consumer willing to pay for increased performance in X?

--

### - How will my product compete against competitors in the market?

--

## **Answers depend on knowing what people want**

1. If you haven't already, install everything on the [software page](https://madd.seas.gwu.edu/2024-Fall/software.html)

2. Stand up, meet each other, (maybe form teams?...use [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y-ApfpujwbywjL05KCmUo-AzZqRheqq7_M_vLuEnjt0/edit?usp=sharing))

## Your turn

### A. Practice getting organized

1. Open RStudio and create a new R project called `week1`.
2. Create a new R script and save it as `practice.R`.
3. Open the `practice.R` file and write your answers to these questions in it.

### B. Creating & working with objects

1). Create objects to store the values in this table:

| City              | Area (sq. mi.) | Population (thousands) |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| San Francisco, CA | 47             | 884                    |
| Chicago, IL       | 228            | 2,716                  |
| Washington, DC    | 61             | 694                    |

2) Using the objects you created, answer the following questions:

  - Which city has the highest density?
  - How many _more_ people would need to live in DC for it to have the same population density as San Francisco?

## Example: **wikifacts**

Install the [Wikifacts](https://github.com/keithmcnulty/wikifacts) package, by Keith McNulty:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("wikifacts")
```

--

Load the package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(wikifacts) # Load the library
```

--

Use one of the package functions

```{r eval=FALSE}
wiki_randomfact()
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
wikifacts::wiki_randomfact()
```

---

## Example: **wikifacts**

Now, restart your RStudio session:
> Session -> Restart R

--

Try using the package function again:

```{r, error=TRUE}
wiki_randomfact()
```

---

# Using only _some_ package functions

### You don't always have to load the whole library.

--

### Functions can be accessed with this pattern:
`packagename::functionname()`

--

```{r}
wikifacts::wiki_randomfact()
```
